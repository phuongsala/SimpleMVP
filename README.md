# SimpleMVP

This repository is an example about MVP (Model-View-Presenter) in Android.

Using the MVP pattern for Android through Login feature. 

User can login via a dummy account. 

Then, if user want to login via facebook, google, twitter...we can add more codes very quickly. 

It's quite easy to maintain onwards. That is the reason why I choose MVP.
